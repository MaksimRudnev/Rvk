\title{
Get Posts from a User Wall
}


\description{
Returns a data.frame with publicly available information about posts from a user wall
}


\usage{
getUserWall(user_id, access_token, num_posts = 'all', verbose = FALSE)
}


\arguments{
  \item{user_id}{Numeric user ID. Available from user page (see Details).}
  \item{access_token}{Your access token (see ?makeAccessToken).}
  \item{num_posts}{Number of posts to consider. Either 'all' (default) or a positive integer.}
  \item{verbose}{Boolean: suppress informational messages if FALSE (default).}
}


\details{
Many users have their ID as part of their URL address (e.g. https://vk.com/idUSERID, where USERID is a sequence of numbers). In the event users have screen names that do not show their ID in the URL, one can access them by clicking on the user's post (or photo, video, etc.): the post will open with a new URL of the form https://vk.com/SCREENNAME?w=wall-USERID_POSTID). Pass USERID (without the minus sign in front of it) to the function call. 

There are 2 ways to specify the number of posts to retrieve. The user can either pass that number to the function call through the n argument, over (default) interactively type that number when prompted after the function reports the total number of available posts. 
}

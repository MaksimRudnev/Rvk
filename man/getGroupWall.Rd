\title{
Get Posts from a Group's Wall
}


\description{
Returns a data.frame with publicly available information about posts on a group's wall.
}


\usage{
getGroupWall(group_id, access_token)
}


\arguments{
  \item{group_id}{A numeric id for the VK group. Available from the group's page (see Details).}
  \item{access_token}{ Your access token (see ?makeAccessToken).}
}


\details{
Many VK groups have their ID as part of their URL address (e.g. https://vk.com/publicGROUPID, where GROUPID is a sequence of numbers). In the event a group has a screen name that does not show its ID in the URL, one can access it by clicking on any group post (or photo, video, etc.): the post will open with a new URL of the form https://vk.com/SCREENNAME?w=wall-GROUPID_POSTID). Pass GROUPID (without the minus sign in front of it) to the function call. 
}

\item{id}{Post ID}
\item{date}{Date when a post was made}
\item{date_POSIXct}{Number of seconds since January 1, 1970 to the moment when a post was made}
\item{text}{Post text}
\item{comments_count}{Number of comments to a post}
\item{likes_count}{Number of likes of a post}
\item{reposts_count}{Number of reposts of a post}
\item{reposted}{Flag for a repost (1 if a post is a repost) }
